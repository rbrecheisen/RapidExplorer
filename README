DESIGN

RAPID is designed around the concepts of datasets, tasks operating on
datasets and producing other datasets, and views for displaying
datasets.

DATASETS

Datasets can refer to tabular or imaging data. We envision the following
class hierarchy for datasets

- Dataset
    - ImageDataset
        - DicomImageDataset
        - DicomImageSeriesDataset
        - MultiDicomImageSeriesDataset
        - NiftiImageDataset
        - MultiNiftiImageDataset
        - ArrayDataset2D
        - ArrayDataset3D

TASKS

Tasks operate on datasets and produce datasets as output whether it be
a simple scalar value, a table or image dataset. Each task knows what
kind of dataset it supports as input and what kind of dataset it outputs.

class Task:
- input_dataset_type = DicomImageDataset
- output_dataset_type = ArrayDataset2D


VIEWS

Views display datasets.
