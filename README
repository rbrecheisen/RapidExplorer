DATASETS

Datasets can refer to tabular or imaging data. We envision the following
class hierarchy for datasets

- Dataset
    - ImageDataset
        - DicomImageDataset
        - DicomImageSeriesDataset
        - MultiDicomImageSeriesDataset
        - NiftiImageDataset
        - MultiNiftiImageDataset
        - ArrayDataset2D
        - ArrayDataset3D

Use SQLite3 to manage datasets. For every dataset that you load, or that is generated by a task
we add a record to the SQL database. Original datasets (those loaded from file) will be tagged
"original" while generated, or derived, datasets will be tagged "derived". Also, I would like
to keep a copy of final output dataset and intermediate datasets so I can always go back to 
these later. Is that wise? Or should I keep track of versions of the code that produced a
given dataset so I can always reproduce what I did?

TASKS

Tasks operate on datasets and produce datasets as output whether it be
a simple scalar value, a table or image dataset. Each task knows what
kind of dataset it supports as input and what kind of dataset it outputs.

class Task:
- input_dataset_type = DicomImageDataset
- output_dataset_type = ArrayDataset2D


VIEWS

Views display datasets.
